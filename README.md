Why?
----

YNAB reports are OK, to give you a quick overview of your spending but outside that you'll need to export your information and put it into Excel or another application to manually work through. Python has amazing libraries like Pandas available to really chew through data, so the library was designed to scratch these itches.


Installation
------------

pYNAB is a standard Python package, installation can be done via ```setup.py```


Usage
-----

At the moment only very limited module documentation exists, in the near future we'll have some Sphinx documentation

Testing
-------

We have extremely basic testing at the moment, which can be executed via ```setup.py``` using ```python setup.py test```
